/**
 * Creates a new thread.
 *
 * The new thread starts execution by invoking @a run with @a arg as its sole
 * argument.
 *
 * A memory for the thread control block and its stack is dynamically allocated
 * from an internal object pool. As far as an order of threads execution is
 * generally undefined, resource reclamation becomes a bit complicated.
 *
 * Thread becomes terminated either when it returns from its @a run function or
 * after explicit call to #thread_exit(). In order to give other threads a
 * chance to safely synchronize with the given thread or to inspect its return
 * value, the memory can't be freed immediately after the thread terminates.
 * Thus resources used by the thread may remain occupied even if it terminates.
 *
 * Kernel tracks an internal state of a thread called detach state which is
 * either @c joinable or @c detached. Resources of a terminated thread are
 * released when it becomes detached which in turn is achieved as follows:
 *
 *   - The thread was initially created in the detached state using
 *     #THREAD_FLAG_DETACHED flag.
 *
 *   - The thread has been detached using #thread_detach() method.
 *
 *   - Some thread calls #thread_join() on it.
 *
 * In other words to avoid memory leaks either #thread_join() or
 * #thread_detach() must be called for each joinable thread, so that
 * system resources for the thread can be released after it terminates.
 *
 * Once the thread becomes detached it can't be made joinable again.
 * Furthermore it <b>must not be used</b> at all and each reference to it
 * should be assumed invalid.
 *
 * @param p_thread
 *   Upon successful completion a pointer to the newly created thread is stored
 *   in the location referenced by this argument with the only exception of
 *   creating initially detached and running thread. In the latter case
 *   @a p_thread may be just @c NULL.
 *
 * @param flags
 *   Depending on the given @a flags the behavior may differ as follows:
 *     @n
 *   - If no flags are specified (@a 0 is passed as the value of @a flags
 *     argument), then the new thread is created in a joinable state and
 *     starts immediately.
 *     @n
 *   - The #THREAD_FLAG_SUSPENDED flag suspends the execution of the thread
 *     being created instead of starting it immediately.
 *     The effect is alike as if #thread_suspend() has been called on the
 *     thread before actually transferring the control to it. In order to start
 *     the thread, #thread_resume() should be called on it.
 *     Using this flag allows the caller to perform some additional actions
 *     on the newly created thread safely without a risk of being preempted by
 *     it. Adjusting its priority is an obvious example.
 *     @n
 *   - Presence of the #THREAD_FLAG_DETACHED flag causes the thread to be
 *     created in a detached state. If used apart #THREAD_FLAG_SUSPENDED flag
 *     then a pointer to the created thread is not stored into @a p_thread
 *     to avoid possible race conditions of using that pointer.
 *
 * @param run
 *   The thread start routine. If it returns, the effect is as if there was an
 *   implicit call to #thread_exit() using the return value of @a run as the
 *   exit status.
 *
 * @param arg
 *   A value to pass to the start routine as the argument.
 *
 * @return
 *   Thread creation result.
 * @retval 0
 *   If successful.
 * @retval -EINVAL
 *   If @a p_thread pointer is @c NULL except the case discussed above.
 *   If @a run is @c NULL.
 * @retval -ENOMEM
 *   If the system lacked the necessary resources to create a new thread.
