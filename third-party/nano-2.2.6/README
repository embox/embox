	GNU nano - an enhanced clone of the Pico text editor.

Overview

     The nano project was started because of a few "problems" with the
     wonderfully easy-to-use and friendly Pico text editor.

     First and foremost is its license: the Pine suite does not use the
     GPL or a GPL-friendly license, and has unclear restrictions on
     redistribution.  Because of this, Pine and Pico are not included
     with many GNU/Linux distributions.  Also, other features (like go
     to line number or search and replace) were unavailable until
     recently or require a command line flag.  Yuck.

     nano aims to solve these problems by emulating the functionality of
     Pico as closely as possible while addressing the problems above and
     perhaps providing other extra functionality.

     The nano editor is now an official GNU package.  For more
     information on GNU and the Free Software Foundation, please see
