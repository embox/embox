This project is made for the implemantation of 
memccpy() function, based on the POSIX standard.

include folder contains all header (.h) files needed.

programs folder contains the basic (.c) file
with the implemantation of memccpy().

correctness of the embox_memccpy().
It also contains a simple Makefile so
compiling, running and deleting the
generated files to be easy.


Inside the tests folder, the following commands can be executed:

"make", compiles the needed files
